Project: Homepage from The Odin Project's Advanced HTML and CSS Course

A great CSS exercise to practice more layout, but more importantly to implement everything we've learned about responsive web design.

This is the most in-depth I've ever paid attention to desktop, tablet, and mobile media queries, changing layouts, margin/padding, and images based on the view.

I also used responsive images to change some of the image files based on the media query.

Not too much thinking on this one, but a TON of useful, real-life responsive design work that I'll be using on every web project moving forward.
